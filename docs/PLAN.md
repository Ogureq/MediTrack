# Gemocode Development Plan

This document records the phased plan executed to build Gemocode, a privacy-first, on-device iOS health-tracking app.

## Phase 1 — Project Scaffolding

- [x] Create Xcode 16 project targeting iOS 17.0+, Swift 5.9, SwiftUI lifecycle
- [x] Configure file-system-synchronized groups (`Gemocode/Models`, `Gemocode/Services`, `Gemocode/Views`)
- [x] Set bundle identifier, deployment target, and app icon placeholder
- [x] Confirm zero third-party dependencies (no SPM packages, no CocoaPods)
- [x] Initialize git repository and `.gitignore` for Xcode/Swift projects
- [x] Initial commit: full project scaffold with root `TabView`

## Phase 2 — Data Layer

- [x] Define SwiftData `@Model` classes: `HealthProfile`, `MedicalReport`, `LabResult`, `ReportAttachment`, `VitalSample`, `Medication`
- [x] Model relationships (report → lab results, report → attachments) and cascade delete rules
- [x] Build `LabCatalog.swift` — static catalog of 40+ common lab tests (CBC, lipid panel, metabolic panel, liver, kidney, thyroid, vitamins, inflammation markers) with standard adult reference ranges
- [x] Support custom lab tests with user-defined reference ranges
- [x] Wire on-device attachment storage for PDFs and photos (no network upload)
- [x] Configure SwiftData `ModelContainer` for local-only persistence

## Phase 3 — Analysis Engine

- [x] Design `HealthReview` value type as the stable output of the analysis pipeline
- [x] Implement `AnalysisEngine.swift` as pure, deterministic functions (no side effects, no network)
- [x] Out-of-range and critical lab flagging using sex-specific reference ranges
- [x] Blood-pressure classification per ACC/AHA categories
- [x] BMI calculation from profile height and latest weight sample
- [x] Trend analysis via linear regression per lab test / vital, classified improving / worsening / stable
- [x] Data-gap nudges (e.g., no recent checkup, stale vitals)
- [x] Overall health score (0–100) aggregated from findings
- [x] Findings grouped by severity: critical / attention / info, each with plain-language explanation and suggestion
- [x] Embed "not medical advice" disclaimer in every generated review

## Phase 4 — UI

- [x] Root `TabView` with Dashboard, Reports, Review, Trends, and More tabs
- [x] **Dashboard** — summary of latest score, recent findings, quick stats
- [x] **Reports** — list, detail, and add flows for medical reports, including attachment picker and lab-result entry from the catalog
- [x] **Review** — full Detailed Health Review presentation with severity grouping and disclaimer
- [x] **Trends** — per-metric history charts (Swift Charts) with reference-range band overlays
- [x] **More** — nested access to Vitals, Medications, and Profile screens
- [x] **Vitals** — entry and charting for weight, blood pressure, resting heart rate, blood glucose, SpO2, body temperature
- [x] **Medications** — active/past medication tracking with dosage, frequency, and dates
- [x] **Profile** — DOB, biological sex, height, blood type, allergies, conditions
- [x] Share sheet integration for exporting a review as text

## Phase 5 — Privacy & Polish

- [x] Local passcode (salted SHA-256 hash in Keychain) plus optional Face ID / Touch ID and Remember me app lock, implemented in `AppLock.swift` / `KeychainStore.swift`
- [x] Audit for any network calls or analytics and confirm none exist
- [x] Add "not medical advice" disclaimer to Review screen and README
- [x] Empty states for Reports, Vitals, Medications, and Trends when no data exists
- [x] Accessibility pass (Dynamic Type, VoiceOver labels on charts and findings)
- [x] Visual polish pass on Dashboard and Review layouts

## Phase 6 — Docs & Release Prep

- [x] Write `README.md` — features, architecture, privacy, requirements, roadmap, medical disclaimer
- [x] Write `docs/PLAN.md` (this document)
- [x] Verify build from a clean checkout via `Gemocode.xcodeproj`
- [x] Final review of privacy claims and disclaimer language before repository goes live

## Phase 7 — Glassmorphic UI Refresh

- [x] Build glass design system in `Theme.swift` — beveled edge strokes, ambient gradient background, glass card/chip modifiers, and button styles
- [x] Restyle Dashboard with glass cards and a glowing gradient health-score ring
- [x] Convert Health Review into floating glass finding cards tinted by severity
- [x] Apply ambient backgrounds and glass chip rows across all lists, forms, and sheets
- [x] Restyle the app lock screen with the glass design system

## Phase 8 — Feature Expansion

- [x] Onboarding flow — 4-page glassmorphic welcome (track reports / detailed reviews / trends / privacy) ending with mandatory medical-disclaimer acknowledgement, shown on first launch (`OnboardingView.swift`)
- [x] Report editing — edit an existing report's fields, remove lab results or attachments, and add new ones via an Edit button on the report detail screen
- [x] PDF export — export the Health Review as a formatted PDF (header, score, findings by severity, trends, lab table, disclaimer) via `ReviewPDFExporter.swift`, alongside plain-text sharing
- [x] Medication reminders — optional daily local-notification reminder per medication at a chosen time, auto-cancelled when the medication is deleted or marked ended (`NotificationService.swift`)
- [x] Health-score history — `ScoreSnapshot` SwiftData model records at most one score snapshot per day; Dashboard shows a "Score History" gradient area chart
- [x] Trends time ranges — 3M / 6M / 1Y / All segmented filter on the Trends screen, with statistics and trend classification respecting the selected range
- [x] Sample data & data management — Profile Data section with "Load Sample Data" (realistic 14-month demo history: 5 reports, 27 lab results, 28 vitals, 3 medications, created only alongside a non-destructive demo profile) and "Erase All Data" with confirmation (`SampleData.swift`)
- [x] App icon — generated gradient icon (teal→blue with white medical cross and pulse line)

## Phase 9 — Health Import & Report Scanning

- [x] HealthKit entitlement configured in the Xcode project, plus `HealthKitService.swift` for importing vitals
- [x] Profile Data-section import UI — one-tap "Import from Apple Health" action with incremental since-last-import fetching (first import covers the past year; later imports fetch only readings since the last import)
- [x] On-device Vision OCR pipeline over report photo/PDF attachments (`LabScanService.swift`)
- [x] Lab synonym dictionary (`LabSynonyms.swift`, 41 aliases) with longest-match word-boundary matching against the lab catalog
- [x] Scan-results confirmation sheet (`ScannedResultsSheet.swift`) with review-before-add before detected values are added to the report

## Phase 10 — Health Features & UI Polish

- [x] Symptoms journal — log symptoms with a 1–10 severity slider, quick-pick chips for common symptoms, notes, and date (`Views/SymptomsView.swift`); entries from the last two weeks feed the Health Review — a severity-8+ entry raises a needs-attention finding, and 3+ recent entries produce an informational summary
- [x] Appointments — track upcoming/past appointments with doctor and location, an optional local-notification reminder 24h before, a "Next Appointment" card on the Dashboard, and an informational finding in the Health Review (`Views/AppointmentsView.swift`)
- [x] New vitals — Respiratory Rate (typical 12–20 breaths/min) and Sleep (7–9 h), each with engine checks (short sleep <6h raises attention; out-of-range respiratory rate raises attention) and available in charts/trends alongside existing vitals
- [x] Derived lipid insights — engine computes the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (ideal <3.5, target <5; ≥5 raises attention) and non-HDL cholesterol (≥160 mg/dL raises attention) whenever both labs are present
- [x] Medical ID — emergency info card under More (name, DOB/age, sex, blood type prominently, height, allergies, conditions, active medications) with a shareable plain-text summary (`Views/MedicalIDView.swift`)
- [x] UI polish — app-wide rounded type design; health-score ring animates on appear with numeric content transitions; Trends charts support touch scrubbing with a frosted-glass value tooltip; haptic feedback on saves; lock screen prompts Face ID immediately; Dashboard date header and next-appointment card; More tab reorganized (Vitals/Symptoms/Medications/Appointments + Medical ID/Profile)

## Phase 11 — Data Ownership & Hardening

- [x] Lab test detail screens — tapping any lab value in the Health Review or a report's detail opens a dedicated screen (`Views/LabDetailView.swift`) with the latest value and status, a full history chart with the reference-range band, what the test measures, plain-language meaning of high and low values, typical range/unit/category details, and every recorded entry with per-entry status
- [x] Backup & restore — Profile → Data "Export Backup" (one JSON file containing profile, reports with lab results and attachments, vitals, medications, symptoms, appointments, and score history) and "Restore from Backup" (replace-all with confirmation; reminders must be re-enabled afterward), implemented in `Services/BackupService.swift` with a versioned Codable payload
- [x] Dashboard sparklines — each vital tile on the Dashboard shows a mini 12-point trend sparkline
- [x] Full codebase audit — two-agent sweep of all models, services, views, and the Xcode project file for compile errors, API mismatches, SwiftData pitfalls, and crash-level bugs; fixed an invalid SF Symbol name for the temperature vital icon and a Profile-screen hang after "Erase All Data" by recreating a blank profile

## Phase 12 — Goals, Units, Editing & Optional AI

- [x] Health goals — `HealthGoal` model with progress from start value to target, Goals screen, Dashboard progress card, backup/sample-data/erase coverage
- [x] Unit preferences — kg/lb, °C/°F, mg/dL vs mmol/L conversion layer (`Support/Units.swift`) applied to entry sheets, charts, trends, tiles, and engine texts
- [x] Medication and appointment editing — tap-to-edit sheets with in-place updates and notification rescheduling
- [x] Optional AI plain-language summaries — bring-your-own Anthropic API key (`Services/AISummaryService.swift`), review-text-only payload, refusal and error handling, glass AI card on the Review screen
- [x] Structural verification pass across all Swift sources (brace/paren balance)

## Phase 13 — Login & Remember Me

- [x] Local numeric passcode (4–8 digits) stored as a salted SHA-256 hash in the iOS Keychain, plus optional Face ID / Touch ID login, implemented in `Services/AppLock.swift` (lock coordinator) and `Services/KeychainStore.swift` (Keychain wrapper)
- [x] Login panel (`Views/LoginView.swift`) with passcode field, "Unlock with Face ID/Touch ID" button, and a "Remember me" toggle that keeps the session signed in across launches until Lock Now is tapped or the toggle is turned off; without Remember me, the app requires login whenever it returns from the background
- [x] Profile → "Login & Security" section — require-login toggle, Set/Change/Remove Passcode, Use Face ID/Touch ID toggle, Stay-signed-in (Remember me) toggle, and a Lock Now button
- [x] Fail-open safety — the lock never locks the user out: if no passcode is set and biometrics are unavailable, the app remains accessible

## Phase 14 — Hardening

- [x] Medication interaction warnings — a curated, educational checker (~20 drug classes, 20 well-established interaction rules) that flags risky combinations among active medications, surfaced in the Medications screen and Health Review findings. Educational only, not exhaustive — users are prompted to confirm with a pharmacist.
- [x] Passcode & biometric login finalization — comprehensive on-device authentication (salted SHA-256 in Keychain, Face ID / Touch ID, Remember me toggle) hardening the app's security posture against unauthorized access
- [x] XCTest unit-test suite — tests covering the analysis engine, services, and data models, implemented in `GemocodeTests/` with comprehensive coverage of critical paths
- [x] GitHub Actions CI — automated testing workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) running `xcodebuild test` on macOS for every push, ensuring all tests pass before merge

## Phase 15 — Widgets & Deeper Health Integration

- [x] HealthKit write-back — implemented opt-in toggle in Profile to save logged vitals (blood pressure as systolic/diastolic correlation) back to Apple Health, extending the bidirectional health data flow
- [x] Richer trend charts — enhanced Trends visualization with healthy-range band, period average line, min/max markers, gradient fill, and dual-series blood-pressure charting for deeper trend analysis
- [x] Home-screen widget extension — created Health Score widget (small & medium sizes) displaying latest score ring, headline, and recent vitals via a shared app-group snapshot, enabling quick health status glance from home screen

## Phase 16 — Roadmap P1: Activation, Trust, and the AI Analyst

- [x] Personalized onboarding quiz — enhanced onboarding flow that gathers health profile basics and preferences before the welcome tour
- [x] Today dashboard — dedicated daily view with personalized supplement and habit reminders, completion tracking, multi-day streaks, and optional daily notifications
- [x] AI Health Analyst structured report — enhanced AI summary feature that narrates findings with verified citations to your data; engine computes numbers and findings, AI provides narrative structure; falls back to rule-based review
- [x] Deterministic health timeline — chronological view of all health events (labs, vitals, symptoms, medications, appointments) with consistent, reproducible ordering
- [x] Passphrase-encrypted backups (AES-GCM) — backup export now uses AES-GCM encryption with user-supplied passphrase, improving security of exported files
- [x] Login attempt lockout — automatic lockout after repeated failed login attempts to prevent brute-force passcode guessing
- [x] Shareable redacted score card — generate health-score summary with trends and vitals, omitting sensitive details, suitable for sharing with healthcare providers
- [x] Privacy & Your Data explainer — dedicated educational screen documenting on-device storage, data protection, data ownership, and control
- [x] Re-test and score-change notifications — optional push notifications alert on lab re-test recommendations (90-day intervals) and meaningful score changes

## Phase 17 — Roadmap P2 Wave 1: Effortless Data Entry

- [x] Quick Add — a Dashboard sheet where the user types one natural sentence ("aspirin 100mg twice daily", "bp 128/82", "dentist tomorrow 3pm") and a deterministic on-device parser (`Services/QuickAddParser.swift`, 43 unit tests) turns it into a live-previewed draft medication, vital, symptom, appointment, or reminder — confirm to save
- [x] AI-assist fill (optional) — when the deterministic parser can't read a genuine attempt and an API key is configured, a "Fill with AI" button sends the sentence to a small model under a strict single-JSON-object contract; the response is re-validated against the same plausibility bounds as the parser (20 networking-free unit tests) and labeled "AI-filled — please double-check"
- [x] Modernized add/edit sheets — all six add sheets (medications, vitals, symptoms, appointments, goals, reminders) redesigned from dense forms into scrollable glass-card layouts with one-tap suggestion chips, icon-chip pickers, and an auto-expanding "Add details" disclosure for secondary fields; save and validation logic unchanged

## Phase 18 — Roadmap P2 Wave 2: AI Companion & Premium

- [x] "Ask about this report" AI chat — a chat sheet on the Health Review (`Services/AIChatService.swift`, `Views/AIChatView.swift`) constrained to the current score and findings; conversation memory is client-held only, answers carry educational framing with doctor/pharmacist nudges, and only the review summary ever leaves the device
- [x] Premium scaffolding — StoreKit 2 `PremiumStore` (monthly/yearly subscriptions, verified entitlements) with a glassmorphic `PaywallView` reached from Profile; degrades honestly to a "purchases aren't available in this build" state until a developer account is connected
- [x] Free AI-report quota — 3 lifetime AI reports free (pure, unit-tested `AIReportQuota`), spent only on successful generation; premium unlocks unlimited reports while every local tracking feature stays free forever
- [x] Widget lock-screen privacy — the home-screen widget's score and vitals are `privacySensitive` and render redacted while the device is locked

## Phase 19 — Roadmap P2 Wave 3: Rituals & Biomarkers

- [x] Quarterly Review ritual — every 90 days the Dashboard invites a deterministic recap of the quarter (`Services/QuarterlyReview.swift`, `Views/QuarterlyReviewView.swift`): score trajectory, vital/lab changes with conservative direction semantics (only medically unambiguous metrics judged; weight neutral), streak and goal wins, and doctor questions from worsened items only; plain-text share, 19 fixed-date unit tests, no AI or network
- [x] Biomarker carousel — horizontally scrolling Dashboard cards, one per lab test with results (`Views/BiomarkerCarousel.swift`): latest value, sex-specific status pill via the existing catalog classification, mini sparkline, tap-through to the lab detail screen; grouping logic unit-tested
- [x] AI usage readout — free users see "X of 3 free AI reports used" under the Gemocode Premium row in Profile

## Phase 20 — Roadmap P3 Wave 1: Documents & Lifetime

- [x] Documents library — More → Documents collects every report attachment into one searchable, category-filterable thumbnail grid (`Views/DocumentsView.swift`), reusing the report detail screen's AttachmentViewer for previews; pure flatten/filter logic with 19 unit tests
- [x] Lifetime premium tier — a one-time non-consumable unlock joins the monthly/yearly subscriptions with a "One-time" paywall card; same verified-entitlement path
- [x] Verified as already shipped: OCR plausibility guard (scan values >50× the reference upper bound are discarded) and proactive dashboard nudges (the "Needs Your Attention" section surfaces engine trend/severity findings)

## Phase 21 — AI Premium Pivot: Owner-Funded Relay & AI-First Entry

- [x] Business model — Premium is $19.99/month and owns all AI (reports, chat, AI-assisted entry) funded by the owner's API key through the relay; free tier keeps every local feature forever plus exactly one lifetime AI report as a trial; chat premium-gated in the Review screen; Lifetime tier left dormant (unbounded AI cost on a one-time payment)
- [x] Unified AI transport (`Services/AITransport.swift`) — one client core replacing three duplicated Anthropic clients; relay path (anonymous device JWT, Keychain-cached token, typed error mapping) when a base URL is configured, byte-identical BYOK direct path otherwise; `isConfigured` now means "relay or key"
- [x] AI-first Quick Add — batch extraction turns a whole sentence into up to ten reviewable drafts with per-item removal; premium-locked AI button with paywall tap-through; two review-confirmed parser bugs fixed with regression tests; all plausibility bounds consolidated in `Services/VitalPlausibility.swift` with a parser/AI parity test
- [x] Backend generate routes (`backend/`) — `/v1/auth/anonymous` (24h JWT with premium claim) and `/v1/ai/generate` (report/chat/extract, server-owned prompts and models, refusal mapping, per-user + global daily token quotas); ENFORCE_PREMIUM flag with a one-free-report-per-device KV allowance consumed only on success; App Store verification fails closed pending implementation; 126 vitest tests, strict tsc
- [x] Design project imported from claude.ai/design — prototype analyzed; theme tokens already match the app; per-screen detail pass queued

## Phase 22 — Prototype Implementation Waves, Scan-First Reports & the Gemocode Rename

- [x] Design prototype v1–v3 implemented — Dashboard/Review/Trends/Quick Add/Medications per the imported claude.ai/design prototype; More screen redesigned (profile header card, 2-column health-records grid with live counts, red Medical ID emergency card); six detail screens rebuilt (Vitals metric-card grid with conservative delta colors, Symptoms severity pills + dots, Appointments date chips, Goals gradient progress cards, Documents filter chips + time-grouped sections, Medical ID hero with emergency contact) — all with truthful copy where the prototype over-claimed (no lock-screen claims)
- [x] Scan-first premium reports — report creation is a scan flow (`Views/Reports/ScanReportView.swift`): photograph/import → on-device OCR → confirm decoded values; manual entry retired for new reports (editing stays); single `PremiumGates.reportCreation` flag reverts the whole gate
- [x] Emergency contact on HealthProfile — name/relation/phone + organ donor status, backup-safe optional fields with tests
- [x] HealthKit auto-sync — observer queries + hourly background delivery keep imported vitals current without opening the app
- [x] Legal in-app — native Privacy Policy & Terms sheets (`Views/LegalView.swift`) plus hosted copies on the landing site
- [x] Renamed MediTrack → Gemocode everywhere — targets, scheme, module, folders, bundle ids (`com.ogureq.gemocode`), app group, deep links (`gemocode://`), relay worker name; CI green on the renamed project

## Phase 23 — Scan → AI Report → PDF Pipeline

- [x] Auto-AI after scan — saving a scan with confirmed lab values flows straight into the AI Health Analyst: the sheet becomes an AI Analysis stage (generate → verified report inline, reusing the Review screen's visual language); failures never block or lose the already-saved scan
- [x] AI report PDF export (`Services/AIReportPDFExporter.swift`) — paginated US-Letter PDF (scanned-values table with status dots, AI overview and sections, score context, "Questions & topics for your doctor" with a discuss-with-your-doctor lead-in, dual disclaimers); attached to the report as a `ReportAttachment` so it lands in Documents, then shared via the system sheet; pure `layoutBlocks`/`layoutText` core with 8 content unit tests, including a regression that the fixed copy never issues an imperative "take" instruction
- [x] One free AI scan — the lifetime AI-report meter (`AIReportQuota`) now also admits free users into the scan flow while their trial remains, consumed only on a successful generation after entitlements resolve; paywall and locked-state copy updated to "one free AI scan and report"

## Phase 24 — Performance Wave & Medical-Grade PDF

- [x] Main-thread unblocking — backup export/restore's 310k-round PBKDF2 + whole-store JSON + AES-GCM moved off the main actor (wire format untouched) with progress spinners on both passphrase sheets; camera JPEG encoding detached from the UIKit callback; AI-PDF export yields so its progress state paints; first HealthKit sync yields every 100 inserts
- [x] Render-path caching — Trends series cached (no more full rebuild per chart-scrub tick), Dashboard vitals grouped once per render + earliest-data date cached, More-screen document count cached, vitals detail narrowed with a #Predicate query, lab detail results cached; established `.task(id:)` convention applied everywhere it was missing
- [x] Storage efficiency — Documents no longer faults every attachment blob to show file sizes (lazy per-visible-row byte counts behind a cache-first actor); all captured/imported photos downsampled to ≤2200px before storage (60–85% smaller, OCR-legible) via new `ImageDownsampler` with tests; thumbnail/byte-count caches bounded; scan flow OCRs only newly attached documents and drops its six always-live table subscriptions
- [x] AI report PDF, medical-grade — gradient header band, "Needs attention" summary box (or all-clear), typical-range column with zebra/status-tinted table rows, section rules, per-page footers with page numbers; content tests extended
- [x] Lifestyle & nutrition section — the AI report now includes "Lifestyle & nutrition to discuss" for out-of-range markers only: mainstream dietary/hydration topics framed strictly as discuss-with-your-doctor items (never fixes, doses, brands, supplements, or medication instructions), encoded identically in the relay's server-owned prompt and the BYOK prompt; verification guards confirmed compatible; backend 128 tests green

## Phase 25 — Relay Live, Retest Schedule & the Money-Saving Reposition

- [x] Relay deployed and wired — the owner's Cloudflare Worker (gemocode-relay) is live with secrets in Cloudflare's store; its URL is the compiled-in default AI route (BYOK/off-relay override behavior unchanged); ENFORCE_PREMIUM stays "false" until App Store verification ships
- [x] Retest schedule — pure `RetestSchedule` engine (38 catalog tests with commonly recommended intervals, overdue/due-soon/upcoming classification from each series' latest result, 20 fixed-date tests), a Dashboard "Tests due" card, and an interval-aware post-scan retest nudge; every mention carries "your doctor may advise a different schedule"
- [x] Timing-first Dashboard — the retest story is the hero directly under the score: "Tests due" when something needs attention, a green "You're caught up — next: <test> <when>" when nothing does, and a scan-first hero for users with no labs yet; all three lead to the new full Retest Schedule screen (Overdue / Due soon / Upcoming with last-tested and due dates, the Upcoming footer carrying the skip-duplicate-tests message)
- [x] Marketing repositioned — all assets now lead with the money-and-timing story (never lose a result, know when you're due and when you're not, skip duplicate tests) with privacy as the strong second pillar; every stale "free scanning" claim resolved to the real tiering (tracking + basic Quick Add free forever, one free AI scan-and-report trial, scanning/AI Premium at $19.99/mo); App Store fields re-verified within limits

## Phase 26 — Russian Localization & Light Theme

- [x] Settings — new "Appearance & Language" section in Profile: Theme (System/Dark/Light, default Dark) and Language (System/English/Русский); language switch applies live via the locale environment plus AppleLanguages for full effect after relaunch
- [x] Light theme — additive design-system palette in Theme.swift (white-washed glass fills, flat dark hairlines, scheme-aware ambient background) with dark mode byte-identical; share card and PDF exporters stay intentionally dark; a hardcoded-color polish pass across ~14 views remains as follow-up
- [x] Russian, three string tables — Localizable.xcstrings (728 view keys from a 9-way parallel extraction, 7 proper Russian plural-variation keys, formal register), Model.xcstrings (20 display names), Engine.xcstrings (435 keys: every finding/recommendation/disclaimer, all 46 lab tests in standard Russian lab terminology); English output byte-identical everywhere via defaultValue, test-asserted strings individually verified
- [x] Deliberate exclusions — Quick Add example chips stay English (they feed the English-keyword parser); unit symbols international
- [ ] Follow-ups: replace the four `%@`-suffix English plural hacks with plural-aware keys; localize notification banners (service layer); goal/diet chip display-name mapping (stored tags must not change); teach QuickAddParser Russian keywords; light-mode color polish pass; AI report output language option via relay

## Phase 27 — Editorial Redesign (from the claude.ai/design canvas)

- [x] Design imported — the "Gemocode - Editorial Redesign" project (24 screens × light/dark/Russian passes plus a style reference) pulled via DesignSync, distilled into a shared token spec, and implemented app-wide
- [x] Core system — paper-and-ink `Editorial` tokens in Theme.swift (canvas/ink/muted/hairline/inset surfaces, tag and range-zone colors, both schemes); the legacy Glass API rewired in place so every call site renders editorial (flat canvas, hairline cards, no materials/orbs/gradients); `.rounded` retired for default SF with tight tracking; Light is the new default theme
- [x] Component kit — `EditorialComponents.swift`: RangeBar (segmented reference-range bar with position marker + value-derived convenience init), EditorialTag, MicroLabel, outlined/accent pill button styles, ledger rows, PillTabBar; home-screen widget restyled with mirrored tokens (wire format and deep links untouched)
- [x] Navigation IA — pill tab bar Today · Markers · Reports · Schedule · More (Schedule promoted to a first-class tab); Review moved off the bar to the Today score header, `gemocode://review` rerouted to the same presentation without changing the URL
- [x] The bar-and-tag grammar everywhere — every lab value in the app (dashboard needs-attention, scan review, report detail, health review, markers ledger, lab detail) renders name/value/status-tag/range-bar; the retest schedule draws time-until-due bars; vitals get ACC/AHA zone bars; goals/symptoms progress in the same language; lists moved from glass cards to flat hairline ledgers with micro-label headers
- [x] Screens restyled by six parallel agents with strict file ownership — dashboard/nav, labs+trends, scan+reports, schedule+review, profile/paywall/onboarding/lock/medical-ID, and daily-data screens; all engine, StoreKit, scan-quota, parser, and localization mechanisms verified untouched; 53 new localized strings with Russian taken from the design's own Russian pass
- [x] CI-verified after three surgical compile fixes (Charts KeyValuePairs scale overload, a duplicated @ViewBuilder attribute, builder-context assignments in the review range bar)
- [ ] Follow-ups from the canvas: "Action plan" premium screen (7e), editorial AI-report PDF (7s), Medical ID reachable from the lock screen, remove the now-unused ScoreRing, filled-vs-outlined decision on the lock screen unlock button

## Future Milestones

Not part of the current plan; captured here for future scoping:

- iCloud sync via SwiftData CloudKit mirroring
